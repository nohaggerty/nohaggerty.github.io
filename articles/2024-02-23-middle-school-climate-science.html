            <p>There’s a smiling sun that says, “Use the ice to reflect the sunlight and keep the ocean from absorbing
                heat.” So, you drag a cute little iceberg back and forth using your cursor — battling the sun, ping-pong
                style. But each time you miss, the light hits the water, heating it up and melting the ice. The ice
                dwindles and loses its smile. Then it’s gone.</p>

                designing — not just playing — video games can facilitate climate change education. The program is a
                partnership between Northeastern game design professors&nbsp;<a

                Eli Tucker-Raymond and Mike Cassidy at the Boston-area STEM education nonprofit,&nbsp;<a

                    target="_blank">TERC</a>.</p>

            <p>“When you’re building a game, you need to really learn the topic, and you need to learn it very, very
                well,” says Harteveld. “Not only do you need to know the content and the domain you’re working with; you
                also need to be able to transform it. And that requires a higher level of knowledge.”</p>

            <p>In&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://www.terc.edu/buildingsystems/research/"
                    target="_blank">multiple studies</a>&nbsp;conducted by the
                Northeastern-TERC partnership to assess the efficacy of the program, they found that students
                demonstrated an understanding of climate systems through their games. Now, each group is building on the
                program to enhance game-based learning in science education.</p>

            <p>In 2016 and 2017, more than 900 eighth-graders from four middle schools in the greater Boston area
                participated in the educational program, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The STEM
                curriculum focused on computational thinking, systems thinking and climate science. Designed by the
                researchers and participating teachers, the curriculum first introduced climate change topics to their
                students. Then, students were taught the basics of game design in the coding language, Scratch.</p>

            <p>“The kids almost universally loved creating games and loved learning in this way,” says Gillian Puttick,
                one of the researchers from TERC who worked directly with the teachers and students. “When we
                interviewed the kids, they all said that they learned some [additional] science” to include in their
                game.</p>

            <p>In&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3410404.3414256"
                    target="_blank">one of the handful of papers</a>&nbsp;on the project,
                published in the proceedings of the 2020 CHI PLAY Conference, the researchers found that all of the kids
                learned about game design, climate science and systems thinking. But only 7% percent of students
                performed well in all three evaluation metrics for their games — whether the game has a clear purpose,
                accurately reflects reality and is simply fun to play — and only an additional 24% scored positively on
                at least one metric.</p>

            <p>The students who performed exceptionally impressed the researchers. For example, the pong game on the
                warming and melting ice feedback loop: “It’s brilliant,” says Troiano. “These kids, they have learned
                what systems thinking is … They understand how it maps to climate systems and they can even program a
                game” incorporating what they’ve learned.</p>

            <p>For the researchers, the fact that only a small number performed exceptionally simply means the program
                needs to better guide and support students — and better assess them. Both the Northeastern and TERC
                researchers have launched their own follow-up projects to tackle these problems.</p>

            <p>To that end, the Northeastern side launched Computational Thinking for All (CT4All). In the NSF-funded
                project, they’re improving existing metrics to measure learning outcomes and providing additional
                support and guardrails for students and teachers.</p>

            <p>Through a project called&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://studycrafter.com/"
                    target="_blank">StudyCrafter</a>, Harteveld hopes to make game design
                easier and more accessible for students. The project’s site has a growing community of students,
                teachers, researchers, lawyers — you name it — creating games applied to real-world situations.</p>

            <p>The learning style that the Northeastern and TERC researchers are proposing is a paradigm shift. Instead
                of using an “instructionist” approach to education where teachers simply lecture, they’re using a “<a
                    href="https://www.wgu.edu/blog/what-constructivism2005.html#:~:text=Constructivism%20is%20based%20on%20the,new%20things%20that%20they%20learn."
                    target="_blank">constructionist</a>” approach for topics that pair well
                with systems thinking. It emphasizes hands-on learning and building knowledge together.</p>

            <p>“In a truly constructivist environment, you learn from your peers more than from your teacher,” says
                Troiano. “It’s a more distributed, democratic approach to learning.”</p>

            <p>The constructivist philosophy is also “about kids being digital natives and much quicker to problem solve
                and figure things out in the digital world than adults” usually can, says Puttick. In Building Systems
                from Scratch, there were always “a handful of kids in the class who knew [coding] and could act as
                experts who could help the other kids.”</p>

            <p>But bringing this type of education into the mainstream won’t be easy, says Puttick. Addressing systemic
                problems in education — like administration distrusting teachers and passing down strict, limiting
                guidelines — is necessary for it to thrive in the real world. And instead of giving teachers marching
                orders, Puttick says, school administrators need to give them room for creativity and autonomy in their
                teaching.</p>

            <p>In fact, It was school administrators like this who made Building Systems from Scratch possible in the
                first place. “[They] created this wonderful space for us to be doing the project with those teachers
                because [they] grasp how engaging and exciting the opportunities are,” says Puttick.</p>
