            <p>In early September 2021,&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9977226"
                    target="_blank">researchers lowered a device</a>&nbsp;into the water for
                the first time, off the coast of Rhode Island. It’s a string of wires, electronics and microphones that
                look like Christmas lights but a tenth of a mile long. When the researchers finally turned it on, it
                recorded the sounds of marine life in an area larger than the state of Connecticut.</p>

            <p><a href="https://ece.northeastern.edu/fac-ece/purnima/NUarray.html"
                    target="_blank">They heard</a>&nbsp;whales singing in “whoops” and “woos,”
                buzzing like a zipper, creaking like a door and blowing bubbles. The dolphins whistled and clicked. The
                fish used air-filled swimming bladders to grunt and “knock” like a hand on wood. It was a rich
                soundscape, a portrait of an underwater world.</p>

            <p>Light doesn’t travel nearly as far underwater as above. Sound, on the other hand, can travel a greater
                distance in water than in air. “That’s why all of the ocean organisms have developed sound as the
                primary mechanism for communication,” says&nbsp;<a

                Computer Engineering at Northeastern and director of the lab developing the array. The researchers are
                taking advantage of this phenomenon.</p>

            <p>The array consists of 160 hydrophones, a type of underwater microphone, developed by
                Northeastern’s&nbsp;<a

                    target="_blank">Laboratory for Ocean Acoustics and Ecosystem Sensing</a>.
                It’s one of the longest — and most cost-effective — wide-band sensing arrays in academia. With this
                combination of price and power, the team aims to give researchers around the world unprecedented access
                to its extraordinary sensing capability: not only continuously recording faint sounds over large areas
                but also pinpointing where each sound originates. It’s not just for the wonder of hearing such peculiar
                sounds. The recordings from the device — and the greater understanding of ecosystems that they provide —
                can aid marine life conservation and management.</p>

            <h3>Science using ocean sounds</h3>

            <p>In a 2019 excursion, the Northeastern team&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://academic.oup.com/icesjms/article/80/6/1727/7218794"
                    target="_blank">brought a prototype of their hydrophone array</a>&nbsp;to
                the lower west coast of Norway to listen for coastal cod fish during mating season. Over a few days,
                they heard thousands of cod grunts and knocks and were able to map the distribution of the fish. The
                researchers say the results show that the technique could be used to learn about the reproductive habits
                of the fish and help manage the species’ numbers, as they are vital to fisheries, commerce and the diets
                of Norwegians. The team has multiple expeditions with the device already lined up for the coming years.
            </p>

            <p>The ability to hear marine species in real-time over such a large area makes these devices ideal for
                monitoring not just the individual creatures themselves, but entire ecosystems. The hydrophones allow
                scientists to map multiple species in relation to one another, study their habits and understand the
                impact of human activity, like fishing. They can also monitor the sound levels of ocean infrastructure
                projects like offshore drilling and wind farms.</p>

            <p>“We listen to everything. It’s a really good tool to say, ‘hey, look, this is exactly what is going on,’”
                says Matthew Schinault, a Ph.D. student who’s been working on the project since he was an undergraduate.
            </p>

            <p>Most of the hydrophone arrays in operation are owned by the Navy and defense contractors, where they’re
                primarily used for locating vessels. Schinault says that developing the tool at the university level
                allows the researchers to provide a full picture, without ulterior motives. “We’re not doing stuff for
                the military, and we’re not conservationists. We’re scientists.”</p>

            <h3>How hydrophones hear</h3>

            <p>The massive array had humble beginnings. The&nbsp;<a
                    href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8867239"
                    target="_blank">project’s first expedition</a>&nbsp;started on a dreary,
                cold October morning in 2018, right in the middle of hurricane season. Schinault had called up his
                fisher acquaintances for a ride. One offered his boat, but not before some tongue-in-cheek responses —
                why would you want to toy with a heavy contraption when you could go fishing? With a science crew of
                five, they headed toward whale-watching boats they had tracked on a maritime traffic website. Miles off
                the coast in Massachusetts Bay, they dropped in a prototype of the device, 25 feet long with eight
                microphones.</p>

            <p>With the prototype, they were attempting to demonstrate the primary benefits of using an array of
                hydrophones strung together in a row, as opposed to a single hydrophone.</p>

            <p>If “you have just one sensor, you get sound coming from all different directions, and you cannot tell
                where the sound is coming from,” says Ratilal. “That’s why we also have two ears, to allow for
                stereographic projection to figure out directions.”</p>

            <p>Additionally, using a technique called “beamforming,” the researchers can greatly increase the
                signal-to-noise ratio with hydrophone arrays. After identifying the direction of the sound, they enhance
                the sound in that direction and suppress noise coming from elsewhere.</p>

            <p>After the Northeastern team first dropped the prototype into Massachusetts Bay, they crowded around the
                computer bolted to the wooden desk inside the rocking boat. Then, the array heard a low, soft sound
                sweeping downward in pitch: a humpback whale.</p>

            <p>“We start seeing it on a computer screen. I was just ecstatic … It felt like we had this connection
                because I’ve been listening to their vocalizations for so long,” says Schinault.</p>

            <p>With the array, they could track the whale, who was close to the surface popping up for air a little over
                a mile away. Over the course of the day, they heard several other whales and the distant hum of the
                whale-watching vessel.</p>

            <p>Melding all of these sound processing techniques together to create a real-time map of what is making
                sounds and where is no simple task. Hamed Mohebbi-Kalkhoran, an MIT postdoc who completed his Ph.D. in
                the Northeastern lab, works on the software responsible for this technology. To make it happen, the
                program first identifies a sound through the background static, then classifies what creature is
                responsible for the vocals and finally where that creature is swimming — and it does all of this the
                second the audio waves hit the hydrophones.</p>

            <h3>The basement was the beginning</h3>

            <p>Ratilal’s team developed the full 160-hydrophone array — a device twice as long as a football field — in
                a basement lab space no bigger than a bedroom. The team works on it in smaller chunks when possible —
                roughly 50 to 150 feet sections — but when the whole array needs an upgrade or testing, the team
                utilizes every corner of Northeastern’s Boston urban campus.</p>

            <p>Early in the project, the team snaked the array along the floor of the Renaissance Parking Garage to
                slide the electronics into a protective rubber-like tube. With their pump and five-gallon buckets of
                vegetable oil, they filled the tube with oil to prevent the device from imploding under intense ocean
                water pressures.</p>

            <p>To test the array before deploying it in the ocean, the researchers headed to the Cabot Center pool and
                threw it in with a large speaker. And during the early stages of the pandemic, Schinault even brought
                sections back to his electronics workbench at his home.</p>

            <p>Schinault works on the electronics with another Ph.D. student, Max Radermacher. They’ve developed a
                design that sections the device into compartments that can be worked on individually, and while every
                component must be designed to withstand high pressures, they use as many commercially available
                electronics as possible. The result is a device that’s easy to repair and cheap to build.</p>

            <p>As much fun as the team had — and as much curiosity as their efforts sparked from passersby — the team
                plans to move many of the array’s larger assembly tasks up to Northeastern’s Burlington campus, where
                they hope to produce modular arrays that make the tool more accessible to the research community.</p>

            <p>“I think the vision for the future is to have compact systems so we can get a lot of folks using this,”
                says Schinault. “I feel like we’re on the ground floor for a whole new era of underwater exploration.”
