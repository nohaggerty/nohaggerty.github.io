            <p>The Mississippi River, an ecological, cultural and economic <a
                    href="https://www.nps.gov/miss/riverfacts.htm"
                    target="_blank">hub of activity</a>, is dangerously misunderstood — at
                least, by climate modelers. The river supplies drinking water for more than 50 cities and 15 million
                people, and it supports almost 40% of the bird and fish species in North America. And yet, we still
                don’t know whether in the coming decades it will flood into surrounding land or shrink down to a dry
                shadow of its former self. That’s because, among the three global climate models that can actually
                simulate the Mississippi River’s water level, there is stark disagreement.</p>

            <p>“We’re at a point in terms of uncertainty where the models don’t even agree on the trend, let alone the
                magnitude,” says <a
                    href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/samuel-munoz/"
                    target="_blank">Samuel Muñoz</a>, Associate Professor at Northeastern in
                the Coastal Sustainability Institute, Department of Marine &amp; Environmental Sciences and Department
                of Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering. Muñoz’s research team tests which models are most likely to
                accurately predict the river by looking at the models’ track records.</p>

            <p>The disagreement is a major problem for government-employed water managers who <a
                    href="https://www.mswater.org/members/water-management/"
                    target="_blank">work to ensure</a> that towns and cities have enough
                drinking water and who monitor infrastructure like dams, levees and reservoirs. They need accurate
                information to determine whether they should focus on <a
                    href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20230731-climate-adaptation-how-us-is-preparing-for-extreme-floods"
                    target="_blank">mitigating flood damage</a> by building physical
                barriers and creating stormwater drainage systems, or <a
                    href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2017-02/documents/ws-ourwater-california-state-fact-sheet.pdf"
                    target="_blank">remedying drought</a> by finding alternative sources
                of water and incentivizing water-conserving infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The models simulate the world’s climate with supercomputers, accounting for dozens of factors from
                precipitation to temperature to wind to snowmelt. They focus on general trends and patterns in the
                global climate. But Muñoz is interested in the Mississippi: a small, local detail in the global picture.
                The problem is, the complexity of the relationship between global climate dynamics and local river
                systems creates a lot of uncertainty in the model predictions.</p>

            <p>“Every river in the world can be different,” says Muñoz. “With water, it’s really messy. Some places are
                going to get drier, other places are going to get wetter.”</p>

            <p>To get a better sense of which models can predict the future, Muñoz’s team first looks at their track
                records of predicting the past. They run each model through a test, seeing how well the output aligns
                with the team’s plethora of historical flood data on the Mississippi. The theory is that if a model can
                accurately predict the past, it is more likely to predict the future.</p>

            <p>But collecting data to validate models isn’t easy. Direct measurements of water levels — primarily from
                the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/"
                    target="_blank">U.S. Geological Survey</a>, a federal water resource
                management group — sometimes only date back 10 years. So, research teams including Muñoz’s collect data
                across the Mississippi basin to supplement the short history of direct readings. They scan historical
                flood documents, identify scars in tree rings caused by flooding, look for coatings on cave mineral
                deposits from floods and analyze the distribution of lake and river sediment.</p>

            <p>The team’s first target in their expansive survey of models is the <a
                    href="https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/about/background"
                    target="_blank">Community Earth System Model, or CESM</a>. It’s a
                collaborative public climate model developed in the U.S. and one of the three global climate models that
                directly outputs water levels for the Mississippi River. The research team found that the output agreed
                with their extensive and diverse library of historical data — a good sign for its ability to predict the
                future and a first step in the effort to clear up uncertainty around the river’s future.</p>

            <p>The CESM’s prediction: The Mississippi’s water levels are going to rise in the coming decades. If it’s
                correct, “you’d have a lot of damage and potentially some loss of life,” Muñoz says. “It would also
                probably mean that the entire river would shift its course.” A shift in course would mean New Orleans
                and Baton Rouge would lose their main source of drinking water and one of the <a
                    href="https://www.nps.gov/miss/riverfacts.htm"
                    target="_blank">U.S.’s largest shipping port systems</a>, says Muñoz.</p>

            <p>Using the climate model, the team also found that they were able to predict dry and wet years within the
                overall trend toward more flooding. This variability is dictated by oscillations between hot, still air
                and cold, fast-moving wind over the tropical areas of the Pacific. While the oscillations occur somewhat
                irregularly — every two to seven years — climate scientists can <a
                    href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/el-ni%C3%B1o-and-la-ni%C3%B1a-frequently-asked-questions#:~:text=Yes%2C%20scientists%20can%20often%20predict,which%20includes%20sensors%20on%20satellites%2C"
                    target="_blank">predict </a>the change up to a year in advance.</p>

            <p>In the short term, understanding which climate factors influence flooding and drought on a year-to-year
                basis allows water managers to better prepare. And for long-term planning, understanding the direction
                the water levels will trend is critical because much of the infrastructure around the Mississippi was
                designed to withstand <a
                    href="https://blog.nature.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/Designing-the-Project-Flood-info-paper.pdf"
                    target="_blank">the worst-case scenario flood</a> of the 20th
                century, not the 21st.</p>

            <p>Their findings are a first step toward linking the impact of global climate trends to the Mississippi. By
                applying their model-testing methodology to the remaining climate models, the team hopes to confirm
                which models can accurately describe the river and create a more nuanced picture of how climate factors
                are intimately related to the river.</p>

            <p>“One lesson is how sensitive river systems are to climate variability and climate change. That’s
                something that I think we’re just starting to appreciate,” Muñoz says.</p>
