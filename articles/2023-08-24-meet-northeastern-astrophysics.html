                sitting in a Northeastern lab destined for balloon flights. And, of course, the James Webb Space
                Telescope.</p>

            <p>These collaborative, international experiments sit at the forefront of astrophysics and cosmology
                research. Northeastern’s newest physics professors and their students are working on all of them. The
                collaborations are aimed at solving cosmology’s biggest open problem: We can’t see <a
                    href="https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/focus-areas/what-is-dark-energy#:~:text=But%20it%20is%20an%20important,than%205%25%20of%20the%20universe."
                    target="_blank" >95 percent</a> of the “stuff” in the Universe. So,
                what the heck is it?</p>

            <p>“It’s kind of scary that we don’t really know what most of [our Universe] is made of,” says Arathi Suraj,
                a Ph.D. student working in one of the new Northeastern labs. “So this is our way of trying to find out
                what’s going on.”</p>

            <p>The search for this missing stuff that scientists call dark energy and dark matter is gaining momentum.
                Telescope technology has advanced rapidly, the public is fascinated, and the funding for research is
                flowing. Northeastern’s new astrophysics labs — with its three recent hires and their handful of
                postdocs, Ph.D. students and undergraduate researchers — are trailblazers.</p>

            <p>Dark energy and dark matter are enigmas that control how the Universe will evolve and how the regular
                matter that we can see — from planets to stars to intergalactic space dust — moves, clumps and expands.
            </p>

            <p>Dark matter was discovered from the gravitational force it exerts. Ever since Newton, scientists have
                carefully measured gravity to understand the relationship between the mass of an object and the strength
                of the object’s gravitational force. But in the 1930s, astronomers observed a galaxy cluster that
                behaved as though it were more massive than their math predicted. They then made a bewildering
                discovery: Whatever was creating this extra gravitational attraction wasn’t a fluke in one galaxy
                cluster; the stuff was everywhere. Astrophysicists named the mysterious source of this extra gravity
                dark matter.</p>

            <p>Dark matter doesn’t emit, block or reflect light, so it is extremely difficult to study. But astronomers
                have been mapping it by looking at the way its gravity bends the light from the galaxies behind it —
                similar to a magnifying glass distorting light — in an effect called gravitational lensing.</p>

            <p>The method is popular for a reason: “The thing I like about gravitational lensing is that it is agnostic
                to what the dark matter is made of,” says <a
                    href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jacqueline-mccleary/"
                    target="_blank" >Jacqueline McCleary</a>, the most recent of the new
                astrophysics hires. As far as the force of gravity is concerned, “dark matter could be anything … It
                doesn’t matter” what creates it.</p>

            <p>In the 1990s, astronomers were bewildered again. <a
                    href="https://www.britannica.com/science/dark-energy"
                    target="_blank" >They observed</a> that the Universe, which they
                assumed was stationary and stable, was expanding and doing so at an ever-accelerating rate. The
                expansion was caused by massive amounts of energy apparently hiding throughout the Universe. Astronomers
                called it dark energy.</p>

            <p>Based on current dark energy theories, the galaxies in the Universe will stretch so far apart
                that <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/05/science/space/05essa.html"
                    target="_blank" >in 100 billion years</a>, the number of galaxies we could
                see in the night sky will have diminished from <a
                    href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/hubble-reveals-observable-universe-contains-10-times-more-galaxies-than-previously-thought"
                    target="_blank" >hundreds of billions</a> to <a
                    href="https://www.astronomy.com/science/how-many-galaxies-are-in-our-group/"
                    target="_blank" >a measly two</a>, along with a couple dozen smaller dwarf
                galaxies.</p>

            <p>Ironically, one popular method to measure the amount of dark energy in the Universe is using the maps of
                dark matter. Astrophysicists can determine precisely how much the Universe has expanded at each point in
                its history by looking at how the structure of the dark matter web, mapped by gravitational lensing, has
                grown in size over the eons.</p>

            <p>“They call it the Cosmic Web,” says <a
                    href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/jonathan-blazek/"
                    target="_blank" >Jonathan Blazek</a>, the first of the new hires. “And as
                you change the theory of dark energy or the theory of dark matter … you get different looking webs.”</p>

            <p>After decades of measuring the amount of dark matter and dark energy in the Universe, the conclusion is:
                only a measly five percent of the Universe is made of regular matter that we can see and interact with.
                The rest is a mystery, and to make detailed observations of it, we need resources and advanced
                technology.</p>

            <p>“We’re in a field where you just can’t do this in a lab anymore,” says Blazek. “You need the resources of
                multiple countries and hundreds — if not thousands — of people.”</p>

            <p>Astrophysics and cosmology collaborations thus far, including Hubble, have produced a plethora of
                discoveries in dark matter and dark energy. In fact, the discovery of dark energy itself <a
                    href="https://hubblesite.org/mission-and-telescope/hubble-30th-anniversary/hubbles-exciting-universe/discovering-dark-energy"
                    target="_blank" >came from Hubble observations</a>. Now, the community
                leans in on the handful of flagship observation projects capable of peering past the frontier of our
                knowledge.</p>

            <p>This shift has meant that most observational space science is now coordinated by governments and
                international organizations. <a
                    href="https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/decadal-2020/2020-decadal-survey"
                    target="_blank" >Nine Hubble-sized missions</a> for space telescopes
                and ground observatories are currently under development. NASA, the primary funder of astrophysics
                research in the U.S., <a
                    href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/previous-years-budget-requests"
                    target="_blank" >has almost tripled</a> its investment over the past
                decade.</p>

            <p>“We have some of the greatest scientific tools in human history. And we are well-poised to … tackle these
                mysteries in the Universe,” says McCleary.</p>

            <h3>Jonathan Blazek and models of dark energy</h3>

            <p>Blazek, who joined Northeastern in 2020, heads the modeling and analysis team at the <a
                    href="https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/" target="_blank"
                    >Dark Energy Survey</a> collaboration, where he helps model the
                evolution of the early Universe into the modern Universe. The team compares these simulation results to
                experimental observations from a house-sized telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in
                the Chilean mountains. They’ve found that the most well-supported theory of cosmology, which accounts
                for dark matter and dark energy, has two parameters that just aren’t evolving correctly.</p>

            <p>First, the clumpiness of dark matter — how much it tends to concentrate in certain areas as opposed to
                lying evenly over all space — isn’t evolving as expected in the models. The dark matter in the Universe
                seems either too evenly spread in the modern Universe or too clumpy in the early Universe, depending on
                who you ask. Additionally, the Universe is expanding much faster than expected.</p>

            <p>These discrepancies are strong indications that new physics explanations of dark matter and energy are
                just beyond our reach. But the dark matter map “gives you these sort of lamp posts that you can look
                under for promising theories,” says Blazek.</p>

            <p>Now, Blazek and many of his colleagues are starting work on the next even bigger dark energy
                collaboration: the Legacy Survey of Space and Time. They’re using a bigger camera — weighing
                over <a
                    href="https://www6.slac.stanford.edu/lsst#Camera-design"
                    target="_blank" >6,000 pounds</a> — and a telescope over twice as
                large and only a 30 minute drive south, at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. The collaboration aims to
                collect 500 times more data than the Dark Energy Survey, providing an even bigger lamp post to test
                theories under.</p>

            <h3>Jacqueline McCleary and maps of dark matter</h3>

            <p>McCleary works on data analysis and processing for ground, sky and space observation collaborations that
                map dark matter webs. She joined the collaborations as they were getting off the ground during her
                postdoc at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California and brought them to Northeastern as a faculty
                member in 2022.</p>

            <p>“It turns out that my skill set is one of software development, image analysis [and] bias quantification
                — all of this really detailed, annoying work that needs to get done to make these gravitational lensing
                measurements,” says McCleary.</p>

            <p>One of McCleary’s collaborations, SuperBIT, started as a bold and unconventional proposal: suspend a
                telescope from a giant balloon — the size of a football stadium — and let it float 20 miles up, above 98
                percent of Earth’s atmosphere. Here, it’s unobstructed by the atmosphere, with a view similar to
                space-based telescopes at only a fraction of a percent of the cost. The telescope succeeded in its first
                40-day science mission in late spring, providing a stunning <a
                    href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/superpressureballoon/2023/04/20/balloon-borne-superbit-telescope-releases-1st-research-images/"
                    target="_blank" >view of the Tarantula Nebula</a> with bright red,
                purple, and pink gas filaments weaving and twisting around speckled clusters of stars.</p>

            <p>McCleary is also a member of a collaboration working with NASA’s flagship <a
                    href="https://webb.nasa.gov/" target="_blank"
                    >James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</a>. She simulated what distant galaxies
                might look like to JWST, which helped the collaboration to win 255 hours of intensely sought-after
                observation time on the premiere space telescope in the world. Now, her team is helping translate JWST’s
                observations of galaxies, distorted through gravitational lensing, into dark matter maps.</p>

            <h3>Tsuguo Aramaki and dark matter particles</h3>

            <p><a href="https://cos.northeastern.edu/people/tsuguo-aramaki/"
                    target="_blank" >Tsuguo Aramaki</a> searches for dark matter particles
                that interact almost exclusively with gravity. These theoretical particles include WIMPs, weakly
                interacting massive particles.</p>

            <p>Aramaki is working on a new advanced project, called the <a
                    href="https://grams.sites.northeastern.edu/#:~:text=Internal-,Home,Argon%20Time%20Projection%20Chamber)%20detector."
                    target="_blank" >Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey (GRAMS)</a>, which will
                float up in a weather balloon and search for particles from space that result from the decays and
                interactions of dark matter particles. It’s an evolution of the detector he’s been working on since his
                grad school days. By updating conventional detection methods and searching for particles at unexplored
                energy levels, GRAMS is more sensitive to potential WIMP signals than its predecessor.</p>

            <p>Collaborators in Japan just completed the program’s first successful engineering test flight with a
                small-scale detector. Now, the U.S. team, including Northeastern, Columbia, NASA and other institutions,
                are readying a new iteration of the detector for an engineering test flight in an Arizonan desert before
                it begins scientific flights.</p>

            <p>Aramaki’s lab is located in the same hallway as Blazek and McCleary’s joint lab space. The researchers in
                the professors’ labs frequently ping each other for input when stuck on a problem. All are intensely
                interested in the work, and many chose physics research because of the awe behind these weird, cosmic
                mysteries.</p>

            <p>“We need a young generation. We are doing something new — we need to do something new. So, we need new
                brains,” says Aramaki.</p>
